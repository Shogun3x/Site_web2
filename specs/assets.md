# Asset Strategy

## General Principles
Visual complexity is achieved through composition, not single large images.
Assets should be modular and reusable.

## Background Strategy
Use multiple background layers:
- Base surface
- Flow or motion layer
- Texture layer
- Accent highlights

Each layer has a single responsibility.

## Asset Types
- SVG preferred for scalable visuals
- PNG allowed for subtle textures if needed

## Usage Rules
- Do not flatten backgrounds into a single image
- Avoid heavy images that impact performance
- Assets must scale correctly on large screens

## Buttons
- Use consistent visual style
- Clear distinction between primary and secondary actions
